# Data Section
We have a data set from the Seattle Police Department with a history of more than 15 years.

In an effort to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community, an algorithm must be developed to predict the severity of an accident given the current weather, road and visibility conditions. When conditions are bad, this model will alert drivers to remind them to be more careful.
