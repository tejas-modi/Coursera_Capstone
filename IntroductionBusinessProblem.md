# Introduction
One of the major problems today is Road Safety. Road accidents can be serious or even fatal. The aim of this project is to build a model that predicts the severity of road accidents in Seattle City with attributes as light conditions and weather.
The target audience of this project would be the local authorities for them to help and predict the area / address where road accidents may occur in the future. This could later on lead to applying new road safety measures for the specific areas.

A recent study shows that residential and shopping/commercial locations are more hazardous than village area. The frequency of casualities were high near the  zones of residence because of higher exposure. Study also revealed that casuality rate among residential areas are classified as relatively deprived and significantly higher than those from relatively affluent areas.

By analysing different factors which cause collision, it represents that car accidents are one of the common types of collision occuring everywhere globally every day.
